Restrict subclaim
--------

| To restrict a subclaim, use the command ``/restrictsubclaim``
This will make it so the subclaim no longer uses the same permissions as the claim it is in.

This will change your shovel back to creating normal claims.

I am stuck in a claim
--------

| To teleport out of a claimed area you are trapped in, use the command ``/trapped``.
If the command cannot find a safe area, return to server spawn (``/spawn``) or teleport to
one of your homes (``/homes``). You can't make a home within another player's claim.
