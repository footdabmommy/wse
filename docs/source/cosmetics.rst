Cosmetics
=====
Here you can find details on the shop menu, the equip menu, and the purpose of WSE points.

What are WSE points?
--------
WSE points are a form of virtual currency on the server. They can be obtained by completing quests, 
winning contests, killing bosses, or in our `shop <https://shop.worsserverever.com>`_.
They can be used in-game to buy a variety of cosmetics.

How does the in-game shop work?
--------
The shop can be accessed via the `/shop` command.
This will bring up a gui as shown below.
