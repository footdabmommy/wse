Cosmetics
=====
Here you can find details on the shop menu, the equip menu, and the purpose of WSE points.

What are WSE points?
--------
WSE points are a form of virtual currency on the server. They can be obtained by completing quests, 
winning contests, killing bosses, or in our `shop <https://shop.worstserverever.com>`_.
They can be used in-game to buy a variety of cosmetics.

How does the in-game shop work?
--------
The shop can be accessed via the ``/shop`` command.
This will bring up a gui as shown below.

Hovering the mouse or clicking (on bedrock) the question mark at the top will display information on how many
points you have, as demonstrated below.

From there you can hover the mouse over the cosmetic to see the price of it and a small description of it.

Left clicking it will purchase the cosmetic.
You will also recieve a confirmation message in chat when you have done so.

.. note:: These are a one-time purchase. Therefore you cannot buy the same cosmetic twice.

How do I equip my cosmetic?
--------
This can be done via our equip menu. Use the command ``/eqiup`` to open it.

Upon opening, you will see this:

To access the cosmetic you want, select the correct category the cosmetic is under.
You can find the category name by hovering over the items.
Left click to open that category.

The cosmetics you own will have an icon like in the shop, and will be able to be equipped.

Do I have to use the in-game shop?
--------
No!
Our `online shop <https://shop.worstserverever.com>`_ allows you to purchase the cosmetics from there.

.. note:: This will use real world money, not WSE points.
